### **(V.7.3.21 Changes) (1.20.4 Minecraft)**

##### Items:
Honey Compasses used in Creative Mode will now say they spawned a new compass in inventory rather than failed to locate.

##### Misc:
(NeoForge): Requires v20.4.214 NeoForge or newer due to making use of a new NooForge method.

(Fabric): Made Honey Bucket, Royal Jelly Bucket, Royal Jelly Bottle, Sugar Water Bucket, and Sugar Water Bottle all use the Fabric API's FluidStorage API.
 So these items are now seen as containing the Bumblezone fluids. Vanilla Honey Bottle is untouched to prevent mod compat issues.


### **(V.7.3.20 Changes) (1.20.4 Minecraft)**

##### Fluids:
New textures for Honey Fluid and Royal Jelly Honey Fluid! Special thanks to Kryppers for creating these new textures!

##### Items:
Fixed Flower Headwear not respect item cooldowns disabling item abilities.

##### Entity:
Fix Rootmin crash when certain combinations of mods are on.

##### Misc:
(NeoForge): Uses the new Creative Flight Attribute from NeoForge for Heavy Air to disable modded Creative Flight.
 Requires v20.4.209 or newer NeoForge.
