### **(V.7.0.0 Changes) (1.12.0 Minecraft)**

##### Major:
Updated to 1.20!


#### *\*Additions*

##### Blocks:
Added Ancient Wax blocks! Very high blast resistance, uncraftable, and will give Slowness, Weakness, and Mining Fatigue to 
 anyone who has not consumed Essence of the Bees before and are standing on said Ancient Wax blocks. You can use shears to 
 convert between 3 different patterns for these blocks. Only found in Sempiternal Sanctum. Can be crafted into stairs or slabs.
 Stonecutter has more efficient recipe for making stairs/slabs.

Added Luminescent Wax Channel blocks and Luminescent Wax Node blocks! Very high blast resistance, uncraftable, and will 
 give Slowness, Weakness, and Mining Fatigue to anyone who has not consumed Essence of the Bees before and are standing 
 on said Ancient Wax blocks. If the block has a light in it, people who consumed Essence of the Bees before and standing 
 on said blocks will get Speed, Damage Resistance, and Beenergized. The light forms will repel Piglins and Hoglins and 
 also will count towards empowering Enchanting Table like Bookshelves do. You can use shears to change the direction of these blocks.
 Only found in Sempiternal Sanctum.

Windy Air added that will push any entity in whatever direction the air block is blowing! Only found in certain structures.
 Can be found in Creative Menu for builders!

Heavy Air added that will pull entities down and remove Levitation, Slow Falling, Jump Boost, and non-creative flying! 
 Has no effect on Bees and Beehemoth. Only found in Sempiternal Sanctum. Can be found in Creative Menu for builders!

##### Items:
Essence of Life - The reward for beating the Yellow Sempiternal Sanctum structure! Holding this item in offhand will grow crops nearby,
 heal mobs tamed by you, and heal other mobs or players on the same team as you! It has 1000 use before it is depleted and 
 needs 15 minutes to recharge by being in the inventory of a player that had consumed Essence of the Bees in the past.
