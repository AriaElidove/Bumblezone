### **(V.7.0.26 Changes) (1.20.1 Minecraft)**

##### Entities:
Bee Queen will now ask to do special hidden trades on certain days of the year! 
 These trades will not show up in recipe viewers. There is config option to turn off these trades.
 To see these new special day trades, go to this folder in the GitHub repo sources for this mod:
 `\common\src\main\resources\data\the_bumblezone\bz_bee_queen_trades\special_days\`

##### Misc:
Adjusted priority on Bumblezone mixins to try and make them less likely to break due to other mod's dangerous overwrite mixins of default priority.
