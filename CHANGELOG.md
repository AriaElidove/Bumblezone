### **(V.7.5.1 Changes) (1.20.6 Minecraft)**

##### Dimension:
Added `the_bumblezone:fog_adjusting_effects` mob effect tag to allow specifying what mob effect changes the fog in Bumblezone.
 By default, this has Blindness and Darkness. This new addition now fixes those two to properly set the fog distance in Bumblezone dimension.


### **(V.7.5.0 Changes) (1.20.6 Minecraft)**

##### Major:
Ported to 1.20.6. Might be buggy... Please report issues

##### Mod Compat:
Added special textures for Bumblezone Music Discs to be used when put into Adornment's Jukeboxes.
