### **(V.7.6.0 Changes) (1.21 Minecraft)**

##### Major:
Ported to 1.21! Please report issues and bugs! There's bound to be some due to the workload to do this port.

##### Entities:
Bee Queen trading JSON files changed a bit with the result section to now allow specifying a result item's components.

##### Blocks:
Crystalline Flower now has a dedicated folder of `data/the_bumblezone/bz_crystalline_flower_data` where you can specify 
 exactly what xp amount a tag of items gives. You can now also disable the default 1xp item consuming too!
