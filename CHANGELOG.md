### **(V.7.0.25 Changes) (1.20.1 Minecraft)**

##### Dimension:
Fixed defaultDimension config not actually working.

##### Mod Compat:
(Forge): Checks tool actions now along with an instanceof check. 
 This means Bumblezone's carvable blocks can be carved with more modded shears.
 Comb Cutter can be put on more modded shears/swords too.
 And more modded axes can disable Honey Crystal Shield.
