### **(V.7.0.15 Changes) (1.20.1 Minecraft)**

##### Entities:
Fixed Sentry Watcher not saving and keeping their owner UUID in NBT. 
 For those spawned by egg and now unkillable, use /kill command to eliminate them. Sorry about that.

Made Sentry Watcher Spawn Egg save Creative Mode players as owner now too.

Capped Sentry Watcher max speed to try and prevent stuff like -34616847.45 momentum. Don't ask how someone managed to accomplish that.
