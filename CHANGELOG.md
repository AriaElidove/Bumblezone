### **(V.7.1.0 Changes) (1.20.1 Minecraft)**

##### Blocks:
Fixed the rotation of Ancient Wax Stairs when they are in item form.

Added disableEssenceBlockShaders config option to let people disable the default shaders for Essence Blocks and use normal block textures instead.

##### Items:
Honey Bee Leggings now will eject pollen if standing on Wet Sponge or when in Water! 
 Also, now works with Armor Stands so you can automate Pollen Puff generation! See if you can figure out a contraption to do this!

##### Entities:
Bee Queen will trade for Rabbit Stew and Suspicious Stew now.

Made sure Bee Queen will not become angry at other Bees or Rootmins or a few other mobs.

Fixed crash if spawning Cosmic Crystal, Electric Ring, or Purple Spike outside of Essence events by summon command.

Improved Rootmin AI, so hopefully it does nto get stuck in the ground as much anymore.

##### Structures:
Added small Tree Dungeons to Hive Wall, Hive Pillar, and Pollinated Pillar biomes to help decorate caves a bit more.

Added small Gear Columns to Floral Meadow and Crystal Canyon.
 The small feature holds Flower Headwear, Crystal Cannon, and Bee Cannon can be obtained here.

##### Effects:
Fixed Wrath of the Hive growing Brood Blocks that are too far above or below mob.

Adjusted Wrath of the Hive effect to not run every tick. Might see a tiny bit of performance boost.

##### Advancements:
Darken background for Bumblezone advancement tab.

##### Lang:
uk_ua.json updated by unroman! Special thanks to them for the huge amount of translations done!

##### Mod Compat:
Workaround Lithium, Canary, Rubidium that caused my Suspicious Pile of Pollen block to not be brushable.

Fixed Iris causing Essence of Knowing to not highlight blocks behind walls.

Pollen Puff hitting Sickened Mushroom Cow from Wither Storm Mod will spawn Tainted Mushrooms nearby.

Wither Storm Mod's Sickened Spider will count towards Bumblezone's Too Many Legs advancement.

Wither Storm Mod's Sickened Spider spawners can spawn in Battle Cube and Spider Infested Bee Dungeons now.

Journeymap and Xaero's Minimap will show icons for more of Bumblezone's entities! Special thanks to CrispyTwig for textures!
