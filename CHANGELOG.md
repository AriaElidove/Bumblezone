### **(V.7.0.30 Changes) (1.20.1 Minecraft)**

##### Entities:
Bee Queen will trade for Rabbit Stew and Suspicious Stew now.

Made sure Bee Queen will not become angry at other Bees or Rootmins or a few other mobs.

Fixed crash if spawning Cosmic Crystal, Electric Ring, or Purple Spike outside of Essence events by summon command.

##### Mod Compat:
Workaround Lithium and Canary that caused my Suspicious Pile of Pollen block to not be brushable.

Pollen Puff hitting Sickened Mushroom Cow from Wither Storm Mod will spawn Tainted Mushrooms nearby.

Wither Storm Mod's Sickened Spider will count towards Bumblezone's Too Many Legs advancement.

Wither Storm Mod's Sickened Spider spawners can spawn in Battle Cube and Spider Infested Bee Dungeons now.
